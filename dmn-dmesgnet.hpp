   * 1.    Initialized - [send heartbeat] -> MasterElectionPending
   * 2[1]. MasterPending - [receive master heartbeat] -> Ready
   * 2[2]. MasterPending - [timeout w/o master heartbeat, act as master]
   *       -> Ready
   * 3[1]. Ready - [receive master last heartbeat] -> MasterPending
   * 3[2]. Ready - [send last heartbeat, optionally relinquish master role]
   *       -> Destroyed
   * 4.    Destroyed [cache last state in file?]
   *
   * When a master is about to be destroyed, its last heartbeat message will
   * relinquish its master role, that will trigger 3[1] for all other nodes,
   * and instead of moving all other nodes into passive master election 2[1]
   * or 2[2], all other nodes can do co-election of master by:
   * - each node selects the earliest created timestamp node from the list of
   *   neighbor nodes (including itself).
   * - if all remaining nodes have same list of neighbor nodes, they will all
   *   elect the same master, and all are in sync.
   * - otherwise, different master will be elected by different nodes, but as
   *   those nodes are syncing their heartbeat, they will all agree on node
   *   with earliest created timestamp.
   *
   * for each heartbeat broadcast message from the node, it includes the
   * following information:
   * - the node identifier [timestamp_at_initialized.process_id.ip]
   * - the node's master identifier which
   * - the node's known list of networked node identifiers (include itself)
   *
   * If there are 3 nodes, A, B and C. And it boots up in the following orders:
   *
   * T1: A boot up, and send heartbeat [A, , []]
   * T2: B boot up, and send heartbeat [B, , []]
   * T3: A receives [B, , []], and add B to its neighbor list, but B is
   *     not master, so A remains in initialized (as not yet timeout),
   *     and its next pending heartbeat is [A, , [A, B]]
   * T4: B receives [A, , []], and add A to its neighbor list, but A is
   *     not master, so B remains in initialized (as not yet timeout),
   *     and its next pending heartbeat is [B, , [A, B]]
   * T5: A timeout at initialized state, and self-proclaim itself as
   *     master based on its list of neighbor nodes [A, B] as A
   *     has earliest timestamp at created.
   * T6: B timeout at initialized state, and select A as the master based
   *     on its list of neighbor nodes [A, B] and A has earliest timestamp
   *     at created.
   * T7: both A and B receives each other heartbeat, and then
   *     both agree that A is master as A has early timestamp on created,
   *     and so both will remain in ready state.
   *     heartbeat A = [A, A, [A, B]] B = [B, A, [A, B]].
   * T8: when C boots up, it is in initialized state, and send out
   *     heartbeat C = [C, , ,]
   * T9: A and B receives C heartbeat and both send out heartbeat
   *     A = [A, A, [A, B, C]] and B = [B, A, [A, B, C]], and C receives
   *     either of the message will declare A as master and into ready
   *     state, also keep a list of neighbor nodes [A, B, C].
   *
   * Tn: A is shutting down, and manage to send its last heartbeat,
   *     [A, ,[B, C]] to B and C, and both will notice that the message
   *     is from A but it relinquishes master position, and remove itself
   *     from the neighbor list, and B and C will elect new master
   *     which is B as it has earliest timestamp.
   *
   * The node will maintain its list of neighbor nodes, but if there is no
   * heartbeat from one of the neighbor for N seconds, it will remove it from
   * the list, if the master is not sending heartbeat, then all nodes will
   * participate in master selection by using it last known list of networed
   * nodes (include itself) and elect one with early timestamp as master, and
   * send out the next heartbeat, in good case, all active nodes will agree on
   * the same new master right away.
   *
   * In very race case, two nodes elect different master as one node does not
   * see one or few other nodes that are better candidate for master (early
   * timestamp), then it will surrender its master election result and agree on
   * one selected by its neighbor heartbeat message.
