# Dmn: Distributed Messaging & Synchronization

Dmn is a C++ library providing a lightweight protocol for distributed messaging and data synchronization. 

## Overview
The goal of Dmn is to abstract away the complexities of networking and concurrency. It allows developers to focus on application logic by handling:
* **Networking & Transport:** Low-level socket and protocol management.
* **Message Formatting:** Standardized data exchange.
* **Concurrency Control:** Distributed synchronization of read/write operations on shared datasets.
* **Conflict Resolution:** Multi-level conflict detection and resolution strategies.

## Key Features
* **Delegation-Based Design:** Implemented using the delegation pattern to ensure the library is extensible and customizable without "class proliferation."
* **Lightweight C++:** Modern C++ implementation focused on performance and simplicity.
* **Integrated Logic:** Designed to be easily integrated directly into existing applications.

## Architecture
Dmn avoids deep inheritance hierarchies. By utilizing delegation, you can inject custom behavior into the protocol stack without modifying the core library, keeping your codebase clean and maintainable.

## Build steps
The dmn Dockerfile container:
0. build container - "docker build -t dmn ."
1. run container (interactive mode) - "docker run -it --rm dmn"
2. run 'ctest -L dmn'
3. remove built container - "docker rmi dmn"
