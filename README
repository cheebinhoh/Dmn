This repository contains a distributed messaging and synchronization protocol in c/c++.

The ultimate goal is to implement a simple distributed messaging and synchronization
protocol that can be integrated with Application and free the application from deading
with networking, messaging format, synchronization of concurrent read & write of the
same dataset with support of conflict detection and resolution in multiple levels of
the protocol.

The library is implemeneted in C++ and hopefully it is doing it right way through
delegation design pattern and fully extensible and customizable without proliferation
of Classes.

The dmn Dockerfile container:
0. build container - "docker build -t dmn ."
1. run container (interactive mode) - "docker run -it --network dmn-kafka-net --rm dmn"
2. run 'ctest -L dmn'
3. remove built container - "docker rmi dmn"
